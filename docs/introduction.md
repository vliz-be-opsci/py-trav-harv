# Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for the travharv package!

## What is travharv?

travharv is a Python library that provides tools and utilities for working with RDF (Resource Description Framework) data. RDF is a standard for representing and exchanging structured information on the web. It allows us to describe resources and their relationships using triples, which consist of a subject, a predicate, and an object.

## Dereferencing and RDF

One important concept in working with RDF is dereferencing. Dereferencing refers to the process of retrieving the actual data associated with a resource identified by a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier). In the context of RDF, dereferencing is crucial for resolving the meaning and properties of resources.

When working with RDF data, we often encounter URIs that represent entities such as individuals, concepts, or relationships. By dereferencing these URIs, we can retrieve additional information about the resources they represent, such as their properties, relationships, and related resources.

travharv provides powerful dereferencing capabilities, allowing you to easily retrieve and work with RDF data from various sources. Whether you need to dereference URIs to gather additional information or resolve references, travharv has got you covered.

In the following sections of this documentation, we will explore the various features and functionalities of travharv, including dereferencing, RDF manipulation, querying, and more.

Let's dive in and start exploring the world of RDF with travharv!
